# Existing Code Standards...
Commenting on Files
- A block at the top of each file describing what the purpose of the file is to do, i.e. This is an auto that is intended to park, and score 3 elements in the following order using xyz subsystems.
- A block at the top of each function that denotes the function name, description, parameters, and return variables.
- Add in-line comments to any line of code that is performing more than a simple get/set describing what the line performs.
- When referencing external numbers, i.e. motor inputs, please add a hyperlink to the associated material, whether it’s made internally within the team, or externally within the vendor.

Naming Convention
- CamelCase - i.e. EveryWordOfAVariableGetsCapitalized
- Be specific, provide necessary information for variables
- Be concise, use no words beyond what’s necessary

Magic Numbers
- No magic numbers, always set up a variable when using a number that could be used in more than one place.
